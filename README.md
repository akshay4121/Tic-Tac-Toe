# Tic-Tac-Toe 

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using React.js.

Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game where each player takes turns marking a cell in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

This project was created to demonstrate a basic React.js application, providing an interactive and engaging way to play Tic-Tac-Toe.
